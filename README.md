This repository contains the code we have employed in our natural effects model of the association between socioeconomic position and atrial fibrillation, and mediators body mass index, hypertension, smoking and alcohol. 
We have followed Lange et al.â€™s time-to-event adaption 24 of the method implemented by Steen et al. in the Medflex R package. 
This is a counterfactual-based natural effects model where total effect (TE), natural direct effect (NDE) and natural indirect (NIE) effect of SEP on AF are estimated on a hazard ratio (HR)-scale.
